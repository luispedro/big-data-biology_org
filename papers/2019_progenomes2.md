Microbiology depends on the availability of annotated microbial genomes for
many applications. Comparative genomics approaches have been a major advance,
but consistent and accurate annotations of genomes can be hard to obtain. In
addition, newer concepts such as the pan-genome concept are still being
implemented to help answer biological questions. Hence, we present proGenomes2,
which provides 87 920 high-quality genomes in a user-friendly and interactive
manner. Genome sequences and annotations can be retrieved individually or by
taxonomic clade. Every genome in the database has been assigned to a species
cluster and most genomes could be accurately assigned to one or multiple
habitats. In addition, general functional annotations and specific annotations
of antibiotic resistance genes and single nucleotide variants are provided. In
short, proGenomes2 provides threefold more genomes, enhanced habitat
annotations, updated taxonomic and functional annotation and improved linkage
to the NCBI BioSample database.
